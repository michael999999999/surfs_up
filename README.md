# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview
W. Avy has requested an analysis of temperatures trends comparing June and December, to determine whether ice cream/surf shop operations would be viable year-round.

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.9.7, conda 4.12.0, jupyter notebook 6.4.8, pandas 1.41, sqlalchemy 1.4.22, sqlite 3.36.0

## Summary Statistics
Upon reviewing the summary statistics between historical data from the months of June and December, it is evident there is very minimal difference. For the month of June, the average temperatures according to the provided data is 74.9 degrees. The average temperature from the same data for December shows an average temperature of 71 degrees. While

June Summary Statistics:

Analysis of the June Summary Statistics shows that the minimum temperature throughout the data set is 64 degrees. The maximum temperature for that same timeframe is 85 degrees.

December Summary Statistics:

Review of the December Summary Statistics reveals a minimum temperature from the data set of 56 degrees. The maximum temperature over that same period is 83 degrees.

## Wrap-Up
While there are more data points recorded from June (1700 vs 1517, a difference of 183), there is little reason to believe that having the same exact number of data points would alter the results much one way or another. However, I believe that more thorough analysis could be accomplished. For intance, I would be curious to see how seasonal weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, could affect viability. Also, I believe that a lot of business could come from vacationers, so additional metrics such as traveller volume should be taken into consideration. Overall, it is my opinion that, based on temperature alone, December is very similar to June, meaning that year-round operations would certainly be doable.
